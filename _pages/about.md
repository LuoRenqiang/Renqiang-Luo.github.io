# About Me

I am an Assistant Professor in the College of Computer Science and Technology at Jilin University. 
Prior to that, I obatained my Ph.D. degree from Dalian University of Technology advised by Prof. Feng Xia. 
Before that, I received the BSc. degree in Probability and Statistics from University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), China, in 2016, and the MSc. degree in Data Science from University of South Australia (UniSA), Australia, in 2019
